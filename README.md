# Analysis of Second-Hand Car Sales Project Description Prediction of second hand car sales in 2024.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Handling data types, checking for missing values, and standardizing column names.
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Visualizing relationships between key variables such as engine_size, mileage, year_of_manufacture, and price.
### Machine learning models 
- Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression 
- RandomForest Regression 
- K-Means clustering algorithm 
- DBSCAN
### Dataset: 'car_sales_data_24.csv' It contains 50,000 rows and 7 columns with the following attributes:
- Manufacturer: The brand of the car (e.g., Ford, Toyota, BMW).
